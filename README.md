# intro
This is the .blend database of KarelZe. I do offer a large portion of the .blend files I've created over the last years free for download. All files are lisenced under cc-by. Please use them in your projects, whether they are of commercial or non-commercial nature. 
Many .zip files also contain a .obj or .stl file to be imported to other 3d modelling applications.

All files are created and shared with ❤. Therefore I'd love to see, what you used the models for. If you have any suggestions or if you come across some nasty bugs, just open an issue. If you like it, why not leaving a star. :satisfied:

# How to download
Just navigate to the subdirectory and select the .zip file you want to download. Finally click view Raw or Raw. A window will pop up and the file will be saved to your harddrive. Enjoy.
